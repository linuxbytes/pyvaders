[Source wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders)

> Within the shooter genre, Space Invaders was the first fixed shooter and set the template for the shoot 'em up genre. The goal is to defeat wave after wave of descending aliens with a horizontally moving laser to earn as many points as possible.

If the Alien touches the ship it's **GameOver**

### How to contrubite to the project

Goal: to get more people to contrubite to simple projects without worry about it being serious. To learn how to contrubite to (not limited to) repo, git tooling, documentation, art work for software. 

Some Guidlines âœ… :

- All code must be opensource for theis Specific commit and project

- For any assest added must have source or credit source on the CREDITS.md file. If all Artist feel free to contrubrute  

- Be Nice and Repectful for any new ideas or approaches for changing the code. All skill levels are welcome. 

- You contrubite in any form (not limited docs, art, music, marketing, research etc .)

- If you want to build from scratch check the CREDIT.md for source and course

- All final commit will be to master but ideas or concept must be a branch [git branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging)


### Todo

- [] Create a python package
- [] Create a single binary for distrubtion 
- [] Create add More Levels 
- [] Improve performace
